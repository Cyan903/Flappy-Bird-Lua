# Flappy-Bird-Lua
About 7 hours ago at the time of writing this, I challenged myself to learn a language as fast as possible. I decided to learn lua because its a very straightforward language and is used by a lot of programs.

I made this using [love2d](https://love2d.org/). The tutorials were fairly easy to follow and I had a pretty fun time making this. While I didn't spend much time learning love2d, I feel pretty confident with lua and I'm pretty happy with the final product.

### Install
After installing love2d and lua you can simply run the program with:
```sh
love .
```
